    <p><b>Neutscape</b> is an interactive visualization for viral antibody landscapes.</p>
    <p>An <b>antibody landscape</b> is a comprehensive view of how well an individual 
      can neutralize viruses from the past, present, and future.
      It is measured by collecting serum from an individual and assaying for neutralization 
      against a historic panel of viruses.</p>
    <p>Individual antibody landscapes reflect personal immune histories.
      Aggregated antibody landscapes reveal population-level differences in antigenic
      susceptibility which often corelate with age.
      Therefore, these data can provide valuable clues on what drives us to be susceptible or
      immune.</p>
    <p>The data in this visualization is from <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/81457" 
      class="link">Yang et al (<i>eLife</i>, 2022)</a>. 
      Each point in the UMAP plot corresponds to one of 777 sera collected from individuals in 2014.
      You can <a class="command">hover</a> over a point in the UMAP to view the extent to which an individual was able to 
      neutralize different H3N2 strains, measured using a hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) assay. 
      You can <a class="command">click</a> a point to lock the density and phylogenetic tree plots in place. 
      When a UMAP point is clicked, you can also <a class="command">hover</a> over the nodes in the phylogenetic tree to view
      the exact HI titer measured.
      To unlock the density and phylogenetic tree plots, re-click the selected point.
